PLANT DISEASE DETECTION:


Plant disease detection is the process of identifying diseases that affect plants.
It involves looking for signs like spots, discoloration, or unusual growth patterns on leaves, stems, or fruits.
This helps farmers and gardeners find problems early so they can take action to protect plants and improve crop health.
